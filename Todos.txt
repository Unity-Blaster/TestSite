1. [by Baba] While transitioning b/w pages, make each transition like:
        Prev.Page --> Gets Smaller --> Next.Page appears --> Gets Normal size.  

# For Home.css

1. [by me] Add a pre-loader.
2. [by me & m^3] Add a diff style to the Name entered than the rest of the text.
3. Fix.problem("Hi null!");

# For Header.css + .js

1. add a sys to limit the amount of times the header text can be "hacker animated', or rather, put a cap on it.
2. take the value of header colors and then pick a random from that and put it as text color.
3. add a toggle for the above.
