# **Project-Info**

**Notice: This Is Heavily Under-Development.**

This is all of the code used in my first website, which I created as part of my journey of learning Web Development.

You can go to the website [here](https://unity-blaster.github.io/TestSite/).<br>
If you want to make modifications to the program, you open the files in [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/) (which I used for this project), or in any other Online/Offline Code Editor.

# Contributing/Distributions
Please note that I won't be able to accept pull requests all the time (most of the time rather), as I'm a student who has a lot to do in the real life as well, but you're welcome to create your own fork of the project. If you plan on distributing your version, please make sure that it's following these guidelines:--

1. The project must be free to download (accepting donations is fine), and the source code must be available.
2. There should be some indication, in the distribution, that it's not the official version.
